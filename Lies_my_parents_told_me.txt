the abridged (concisa) version

to ascertain (accertare) exactly what it is

hunk of rubble (grosso pezzo di detriti)

ballpark (stima a spanne)

Yer her smell, it doth linger (rimane)
painting pictures in my mind
her eyes, bowls of honey
angel's harps, her laugh
O lark (allodola), grant a sign
if crooked (scoccato) be cupid's shaft (freccia)
Hark! (ascoltate) the lark, her name it hath spake (has spoken)
Cecily it discharges
from 'twixt (fra, raro) its wee (piccolo) beak (becco).

It's just scribbling (scarabocchi)



Early one morning
just as the sun was rising

Not much for self reflection

See, you strike me as the kinda guy who just careens (procedere sbandando) through life
completely oblivious of the damage he's doing to everyone around him
